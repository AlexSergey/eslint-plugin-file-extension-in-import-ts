# eslint-plugin-file-extension-in-import-ts

## Disclaimer

This is small patch to the great rule:

**file-extension-in-import**

from [eslint-plugin-node](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/) module.

Author of code:

[mysticatea](https://github.com/mysticatea)

I've just added mapping functionality.

## Motivation

When we use type module we must add extension to the file

```js
import foo from "./path/to/a/file"
```
It's a bad practice

```js
import eslint from "eslint"
import foo from "./path/to/a/file.js"
```

It's a good practice.

**node/file-extension-in-import** rule raise error when we forgot to add extension to the import. But it doesn't work with Typescript.

[Full description of rule here](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/blob/master/docs/rules/file-extension-in-import.md)

### Typescript usage

When we use Typescript we can't add .ts extension to the file. It won't be process with Typescript compiler. In this case we need to add .js extension.

In this case we need to replace .ts extension to .js.

In this plugin I will add possibility to make mapping for extensions:

```js
'file-extension-in-import-ts/file-extension-in-import-ts': [
  'error',
  'always',
  { extMapping: {'.ts': '.js' }, forceIndexFileImport: true }
]
```

It means, this rule will fix our ts files to .js extension in import statement.

The property "forceIndexFileImport" will add "/index.js" if you import directory, for example:

```js
import module from './my-module';
```

will be changed to:

```js
import module from './my-module/index.js';
```

## Installation:

1. Install the package:
```shell
npm i -D eslint-plugin-file-extension-in-import-ts
```

2. Add to .eslintrc.js:
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "file-extension-in-import-ts"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "file-extension-in-import-ts/file-extension-in-import-ts": "error"
  }
}
```

By default, the plugin will process mapping:

- .ts -> .js
- .tsx -> .js

## Troubleshooting

This plugin has conflict with [eslint-import-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import), the rule: *import/no-unresolved* rule

To quick fix it we can skip '.js' (in the folder with TS sources JS files are not existing).

```js
'import/no-unresolved': ['error', { ignore: [ '\\.js$' ] }],
```
